    "text": "I’m a soil scientist interested in how we can make the best land management decisions possible for soil carbon sequestration, climate resilience and ecosystem function. I’m currently a 4th year PhD cadidate at Colorado State University working with Dr. Keith Paustian. My research focuses on ecological impacts of solar energy and the effects of integrating regenerative grazing to reduce land-use tension between energy and agriculture and improve the environmental outcomes of renewable energy. When I’m not in the field or the lab, I’m usually trail running, backpacking, or playing in the mountains. Thanks for stopping by!"

    "text": "The transition to renewable energy has raised concerns about the displacement and degradation of agricultural and rangelands, especially with more land-intensive solar energy. My research seeks to understand the ecological impacts of large-scale solar energy development as well as the potential for integrating regenerative livestock grazing and solar energy generation on the same piece of land. These multi-land-use systems have the potential to increase land-use efficiency and achieve a range of benefits across the food-energy-water nexus. I’m collaborating with an interdisciplinary research team to study the ecological and carbon cycling impacts of these systems in the Southeastern United States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor my undergraduate thesis, I studied the potential to create jet fuel from forestry residue to reduce emissions from air travel. Advised by Dr. Eric Larson, I modeled a pathway for converting forestry residue to bio-jet fuel using Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis, then evaluated the economics and potential for scale-up. You can read more about that project here."
