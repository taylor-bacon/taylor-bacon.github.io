    "text": "I’m a soil scientist interested in how we can make the best land management decisions possible for soil carbon sequestration, climate resilience and ecosystem function. I’m currently a 3rd year PhD student at Colorado State University working with Dr. Keith Paustian. My research focuses on the co-location of regenerative cattle grazing and solar PV to reduce land-use tension between energy and agriculture and improve environmental outcomes of renewable energy. When I’m not in the field or the lab, I’m usually trail running, backpacking, or playing in the mountains. Thanks for stopping by!"

    "text": "As we build out solar PV to meet climate goals, there’s concern about the displacement of agriculture and the loss of pasture and rangeland ecosystem. Agrivoltaics, or the combination of agriculture and solar PV on the same piece of land has been proposed as one possible solution. My work seeks to understand the potential of these systems as a climate solution, specifically co-locating regenerative cattle grazing and solar PV. I’m working with an incredible interdisciplinary team to understand how to design and build a cattle-compatible PV system, if it’s possible to eliminate risks to both the cattle and the solar infrastructure, the impacts of the layered land use system on ecological functioning, and the carbon balance for the system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor my undergraduate thesis, I studied the potential to create jet fuel from forestry residue to reduce emissions from air travel. Advised by Dr. Eric Larson, I modeled a pathway for converting forestry residue to bio-jet fuel using Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis, then evaluated the economics and potential for scale-up. You can read more about that project here."
