## Can co-locating cattle grazing and solar PV improve ecosystem outcomes compared to single-use systems?

The transition to renewable energy has raised concerns about the displacement and degradation of agricultural and rangelands, especially with more land-intensive solar energy. My research seeks to understand the ecological impacts of large-scale solar energy development as well as the potential for integrating regenerative livestock grazing and solar energy generation on the same piece of land. These multi-land-use systems have the potential to increase land-use efficiency and achieve a range of benefits across the food-energy-water nexus. I’m collaborating with an interdisciplinary research team to study the ecological and carbon cycling impacts of these systems in the Southeastern United States.

## How can we make aviation fuels more sustainable?

For my undergraduate thesis, I studied the potential to create jet fuel from forestry residue to reduce emissions from air travel. Advised by [Dr. Eric Larson](https://environmenthalfcentury.princeton.edu/experts/eric-larson), I modeled a pathway for converting forestry residue to bio-jet fuel using Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis, then evaluated the economics and potential for scale-up. You can read more about that project [here](https://dataspace.princeton.edu/handle/88435/dsp01q524jr60r).
